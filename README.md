# Woodland Music Festival

#### Artist and Stage Info, 12/18/2019

#### By **Casey Idsinga and Lara Bjork**

## Description
This project was part of the in-class curriculum at Epicodus, during a week focused on routing with Ruby. The assignment from the curriculum is as follows:

_* Create a website for a local festival in the woods. A user should be able to create, read, update and delete a Stage and should also be able to create, read, update and delete an Artist. Artists belong to Stages. For the purposes of this project, an Artist can only perform on a single Stage - otherwise, we'd need to use a many-to-many relationship, which is much more complicated._

_* Start with unit tests and get all tests passing before starting on integration testing and Sinatra. Make sure integration tests cover all the ways a user may navigate through your pages._
